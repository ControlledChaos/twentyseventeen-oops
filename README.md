## Compatibility

* Requires WordPress 4.7 or later.
* This theme was written on a local server running PHP 7.1
* The short array syntax ( "[]" rather than "array()" ) requires PHP 5.4+
* Run a modern setup and you'll be fine.

## Added Features

Features and option that build on the original Twenty Seventeen theme.

Will add here as they are developed.
