An object-oriented and improved fork of the Twenty Seventeen theme.

![PHP version](https://img.shields.io/php-eye/symfony/symfony.svg?style=flat-square)

## Compatibility

* Requires WordPress 4.7 or later.
* This theme was written on a local server running PHP 7.1
* The short array syntax ( "[]" rather than "array()" ) requires PHP 5.4+
* Run a modern setup and you'll be fine.

## Added Features

Features and option that build on the original Twenty Seventeen theme.

Will add here as they are developed.

## TODO

* Add a customizer option for the number of front page panels.
* Add a customizer option to remove front page panel featured images or resize/reposition them.
* Add a customizer option to use a header image overlay.
* Rename this when development is further along. It's best not to have it tied to a year.
